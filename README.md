# Unhandled Division by Zero in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in JavaScript: unhandled division by zero. The `myFunction` attempts to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is 0, but it doesn't correctly handle division by zero when `b` is 0.  The solution provides a more robust way to handle this potential error.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
4. Run the JavaScript files using Node.js or a similar environment.
